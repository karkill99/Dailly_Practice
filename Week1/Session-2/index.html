              <h3>Inception (2010)</h3>
              A mind-bending sci-fi thriller directed by Christopher Nolan,
              Inception explores the concept of entering people's dreams to
              plant or extract ideas. Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who invades
              dreams, is offered a chance to have his criminal record erased if
              he can successfully perform an almost impossible "inception." The
              film weaves layers of dreams within dreams, questioning reality
              and the power of the subconscious.

              <h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
              Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is widely regarded as one of
              the best superhero films ever made. It follows Bruce Wayne as
              Batman, facing off against his greatest nemesis, the Joker, who
              wreaks havoc on Gotham City. The film delves into moral
              complexities, heroism, and chaos, all while featuring a legendary
              performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker.

              <h3>Forrest Gump (1994)</h3>
              In Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks plays the titular character, a simple
              man with a big heart who unintentionally influences many of the
              20th century's most significant events in America. Despite his
              limited intelligence, Forrest achieves remarkable things purely
              through his optimism and kindness, showing that success can come
              from a good heart, not necessarily a brilliant mind.

              <h3>Parasite (2019)</h3>
              Parasite is a South Korean dark comedy thriller directed by Bong
              Joon-ho. The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they
              gradually infiltrate the lives of a wealthy family by posing as
              highly qualified individuals. What begins as a clever con quickly
              spirals into chaos, offering a sharp commentary on class
              inequality, greed, and the human condition. Parasite became the
              first non-English-language film to win the Academy Award for Best
              Picture.
